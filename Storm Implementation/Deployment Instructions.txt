Deployment Instructions:

Download and install Python from python.org

Download and install Kafka from https://kafka.apache.org.

Edit the fileName variables in each java file to point to a location on the local filesystem and build the project.

Start Zookeeper server that was installed with Kafka using its included start script and config file.

Start Kafka server using its included start script and config file.

Edit the "data stream.py" file to point to your dataset and run the file.

Once complete, confirm data was loaded to the Kafka server using the following command:
"./bin/kafka-consumer-groups.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --all-groups --describe"

If successful you will see a value for LAG that matches the number of rows in your CSV file.

Run the java build to process the data loaded in the Kafka server.

When complete, confirm the output file was written and re-run the Kafka command above. The LAG value should now be 0, indicating that all data was processed.
